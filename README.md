# My Custom Design Library

## A Work in Progress for UX/UI & Front-End Skill Showcase

Welcome to my personal design library repository! This project serves as a dynamic portfolio piece, demonstrating my evolving skills in User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI) design, and front-end development.

### 🌟 Project Goal

My primary goal with this design library is to:

* **Level Up:** Continuously learn and apply modern UX/UI principles and front-end development techniques.

* **Showcase Skills:** Present a tangible collection of custom components, design patterns, and visual guidelines that reflect my design aesthetic and technical capabilities.

* **Practice Consistency:** Build a cohesive and scalable set of UI elements that adhere to a unified design language.

### 🚧 Status: Work In Progress (WIP)

This library is under active development. You'll see new components, refined styles, and updated documentation as I continue to build and iterate. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Vue.js 3:** The progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

* **Vuetify 3:** A complete UI framework built on top of Vue.js, providing Material Design components.

* **HTML & CSS:** The foundational languages for structuring and styling the web.

* **GitHub Pages:** For hosting and showcasing the live design library.

### 🚀 What's Next?

I'll be regularly adding new components, refining existing ones, and expanding the documentation to cover:

* Advanced form elements

* Navigation patterns

* Data display components (tables, lists)

* Interactive elements and animations

* Accessibility considerations

Thank you for visiting my design library! I hope it provides a clear insight into my passion for creating intuitive and beautiful user experiences.
